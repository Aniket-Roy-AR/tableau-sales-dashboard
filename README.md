📊 Sales Performance Optimization Dashboard

This project presents a case study of optimizing sales performance using Tableau, based on the popular Superstore dataset. Through this project, we identify key trends, underperforming segments, and high-potential areas that could drive better business decisions.

🎯 Objective

To analyze U.S.-based retail sales data in order to uncover:

Which regions, segments, and categories contribute the most to revenue

Where profit margins are shrinking despite high sales

Opportunities for targeted marketing and inventory strategy improvements

📦 Dataset Used

File: Superstore_Dataset.xlsx

Source: Public Tableau sample dataset

Fields:

Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Segment

State, Region, Category, Sub-Category

Sales, Profit, Discount, Quantity

📈 Key Business Insights

🟢 Top-performing Region: West – leads both in sales and profitability.

🔴 Underperforming Categories: Some Technology sub-categories have high sales but generate losses in certain regions.

🔍 Segment Analysis: Consumer segment dominates but Home Office shows high average order value.

💰 State View: California and New York lead in sales; Texas and Ohio show profit inconsistencies.
